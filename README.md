# Lexer-Parser-and-Interpreter-for-BASIC-Programming-Language

This project is a Java-based interpreter for the **BASIC** programming language. It includes a lexer, parser, and interpreter that work together to tokenize, analyze, and execute BASIC code. The implementation provides a simplified but functional subset of BASIC, making it a great educational tool for understanding programming language processing.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Lexer (Tokenizer):** Breaks input BASIC code into a stream of tokens.
- **Parser:** Analyzes token sequences using recursive descent parsing to build an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Interpreter:** Traverses the AST to evaluate and execute BASIC commands.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic syntax and runtime error detection with helpful messages.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular structure allows for easy addition of new features or commands.
